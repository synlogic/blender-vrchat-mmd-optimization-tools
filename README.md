# Blender MMD Optimization Tools for VRChat
# NOTE: AS of right now I'm no longer developing this.  For a more complete (and absolutely amazing) plugin look for CATS blender plugin.  Does everything this one does and more!
A set of tools to help optimize MMD avatars imported from blender for VRChat  

**NOTE**:  As of right now, all model must be imported using MMD-Tools add-on with blender using MMD-Tools japanese to english bone translation function.  It is planned in the future to allow for japanese named models to work as well.  

The correct version of MMD-Tools with english translation can be found here: https://github.com/powroupi/blender_mmd_tools
# Current Operations
*Optimize* - Trys to apply all operations to the model  
*Fix Bones* - Automatically re-parents the bones to the correct format as well as deletes unneeded bones
# TO-DO
1) Auto mesh-merging that accounts for unitys 65,534 vertex limit in order to preserve blend-shapes
2) think of more stuff to add
